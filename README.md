## Summary
The Brooklyn Film festival hopes to select and show films from August 5th to 8th at Brooklyn Bridge Park, a major entertainment venue in New York that can hold up to 5,000 people.
Its the first time the festival will be 3 day's long so the organizers wanted to have a new website. On this site, they need to display information about the festival, the films they're showing, and regularly published news or announcements about the festival.
